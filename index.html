    <p>
      I have been working in several international teams in Asia and Europe and I, of course, am quite familiarized
      myself with various agile methodologies such as SCRUM, KANBAN and Agile thinking.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am not afraid of cutting-edge technologies being released. I always follow up on the leading-edge technologies
      to keep my professional skill update. All this is just a new-rookie technology which can be acquired easily.

      FPGA based video game, with VGA display controller and keyboard or mouse control
    </p>
    <p>
      The project presented a look at how to implement a signal inputs VGA and keyboard in a FPGA. Field Programmable
      Gate Array (FPGA) technology is gaining popularity among Application- Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC)
      designers. Ease of development and maintenance makes FPGAs an attractive solution to many speed and efficiency
      critical applications. The purpose of this project was to explore FPGAs by implementing a Video game on top of a
      VGA driver. The project was implemented on Xilinx Spartan3E development board using Verilog hardware description
      language. The project was started by learning Verilog as well as familiarizing with the Spartan3E development
      board and Xilinx ISE WebPACK design software. A number of simple applications were developed in order to
      comfortably proceed on to investigation of working principles of a VGA driver. Verilog implementation of the
      classic Ping-Pong Game was the first major task of the project. Ping-Pong, as it was named, is a two player game,
      where each player tries to hit a ball towards the opponent. A number of basic features have been implemented.

      New microcontroller and an FPGA were embedded in the robot and the parallel features of the FPGA the timing
      problem are solved. Our main goal was to write a software module that interfaced between the simulator and the
      embedded hardware. The simulator communicated with the interface program through virtual serial ports. The
      interface program converted that the data received from the simulator from 10 times to one time and then sent it
      on the real serial port to the robot.

      studied at university for Software and Hardware embedded system was quite completely new joiner for this and
      absolutely it was quite amazing educations and courses, I have been enjoyed learning from foreign students'
      Multi-culture and new challenging tasks. There is the best one of the University in the middle of Europa.Thesis:
